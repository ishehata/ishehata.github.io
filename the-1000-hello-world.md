It seems i haved written hundreds of "Hello World!" blog posts before,
Hopefully this would be the last time !

I've created many many blogs before, but none of them lasted, i had some nice
writings on Medium.com but it has been block in Egypt (for God only knows why :/)
for sometime now, and i am feeling that i could start writing again.

### So here we go

Using hugo, that is a software written in Go for static websites -could be used with github pages-
as i probably do at the moment. So far hugo seems so simple, organized, and really fast.


### What am i going to write about?

My fantacies, no really, I will be writing about my adventures in the technology sea, I have been
swimming between programming languages, broken framework ships just floating beside Docker, and i swear,
I saw Kubernetes sucking life from every Docker around it and building his pods on top of a lot of source
code that is gathered from poor developers every where, Come with me, don't fear, it's a journey that
has just started.
