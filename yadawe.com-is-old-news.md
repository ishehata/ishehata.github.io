Unfortunately, being a business man and a software engineer seems to be a hard
equation, hard to acheive.

Some months ago i launched a platform called "Yadawe", an online platform for
artisans who craft handmade products. The main purpose behing the platform
was to help them build their online brand, help them organize their products
and give easy access for customers to view and buy products.

I handled everything starting from the UI/UX to the backend development
with Rails, Frontend using Angular, Deployment on digitalocean. Yadawe was 
a result of constant hardworking for about 4~5 month. The result was astonishing,
I got so many good feedback on the website and specially the ui. Sellers started
to register their stores and uploading their products. Our facebook page was beginning
to finally attract sellers and get them to interact with us.

On the long run, we failed to attract customers, the business was going inactive again,
until everything faded out and just vanished. It's sad i know, but the expirement was good.

Although i liked the idea very much, and wished that the hard work won't be wasted, I am glad
that i did, going through this might have taught me something or two.

Let's have a lookt about how yadawe looked back then

The design kept changing so much, only to improve. 
We even had a mobile app that is just a webviewkit that runs
the website.

Yadawe is dead, but the passion and enthusiasm isn't.

Farewell Yadawe.
